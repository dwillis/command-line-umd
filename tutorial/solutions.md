# Introduction to the command line tutorial solutions

## Navigating the filesystem

Change directory to the `tutorial` directory.

```
cd tutorial
```

Using `ls` or a combination of `cd` and `ls`, what is the most recent fiscal year for which ICE detention statistics are available?

To do this using just ls:

```
ls data
ls data/ice-detention-statistics/
```

You should see a listing like this:

```
FY19-detentionstats.xlsx         FY21-detentionstats.xlsx         FY23_detentionStats.xlsx         FY25_detentionStats02142025.xlsx
FY20-detentionstats.xlsx         FY22-detentionStats.xlsx         FY24_detentionStats.xlsx         FY25_detentionStats02272025.xlsx
```

From the filenames, the most recent fiscal year of data appears to be 2025, and there are two files:

- `FY25_detentionStats02142025.xlsx`
- `FY25_detentionStats02272025.xlsx`

You could also have descended into the directory structure, and ran `ls` at each step:

```
ls
cd data
ls
cd ice-detention-statistics
ls
```

That's a big more work however. Make sure you change directory back to where you started:

```
cd ../..
```

## Creating and modifying files

### Try it yourself

Typing the minimal number of characters, delete the file `data/manual/mock_data/mock_data_1.txt` and delete the directory `data/manual/mock_data`. 

The least typing would be to type `<ctrl>+r` and then `rm `, which causes the command `rm data/manual/mock_data/mock_data_*` to appear.

Then, type `<ctrl>+r` and then `rmd`, which causes the command `rmdir data/manual/mock_data` to appear.

You could have also used the up arrow key to find these commands.

The longest way to complete this task would be to type out these commands.

## Viewing and previewing files

### Try it yourself

What was the type of the first incident in the Tucson Police Activity CSV file on February 1, 2025?

Use less to view the file:

```
less data/tucson/Tucson_Policy_Activity_2025_-2838525216610825691.csv
```

Then, type the `/` character to search and type `2/1` and `<return>` to jump to the first record where the `EventDate` is "2/1/2025". The `EventType` value is "Moving Violation".

## Searching for files and their contents

### Try it yourself

How would you find only FOIA logs for 2024 that are in the CSV file format?

We can update our `find` command with a different matching pattern:

```
find data -iname '*2024*.csv'
```

This should show these CSV FOIA log files:

```
data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv
data/ice-foia-logs/2024-08_FOIA_Log.csv
data/ice-foia-logs/2024-09_FOIA_Log.csv
```

### Try it yourself

Use a different pattern to search the FOIA log CSV files for something of interest to you. What did you find?

I used `grep` to see if there were any FOIA requests about the 287(g) program:

```
grep -Ei '287\(?g\)?' data/ice-foia-logs/*.csv
```

This command is a little more complex than the examples we did together because I wanted to match both "287(g)" and "287g". I needed to specify the `-E` option to enable extended *regular expressions*. I had to make sure to quote my pattern because I'm using special characters. I had to escape the parenthesis because I want to match a literal parenthesis rather than have them interpreted as part of the regular expression language. Finally, I used the `?` to match the parenthesis zero or one times. This is similar to `*`, which we already know about, which matches any character zero or more times.

### Try it yourself

Use `csvgrep` to find requests that match "Law" in the `Requester::Organization Name` column of `data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv` and use `csvcut` to display only that column.

## Redirecting input and output

### Try it yourself

Use `csvgrep` to find requests that match "Law" in the `Requester::Organization Name` column of `data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv` and use `csvcut` to display only that column. Save this to a file named `data/ice-foia-logs/2024_lawyer_requests.csv`.

Let's take this one step at a time. First, the command to filter the CSV file to only rows that match our criteria. This is pretty similar to some of the examples:

```
csvgrep -c 'Requester::Organization Name' -m 'Law' data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv
```

We haven't learned about `csvcut` yet, but let's try viewing its help text:

```
csvcut -h
```

From the text, it looks like we can use the `-c` option to select only certain columns. Let's use that option and pipe the output of `csvgrep` to `csvcut`:

```
csvgrep -c 'Requester::Organization Name' -m 'Law' data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv | csvcut -c 'Requester::Organization Name'
```

To save the output to a file, we'll use `>`:

```
csvgrep -c 'Requester::Organization Name' -m 'Law' data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv | csvcut -c 'Requester::Organization Name' > data/ice-foia-logs/2024_lawyer_requests.csv 
```

Bonus points: Use `uniq` and `csvsort` to get only unique lawyer/law firm names. Then count the number of unique names.

Let's try to just pipe the output to `uniq`:

```
csvgrep -c 'Requester::Organization Name' -m 'Law' data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv | csvcut -c 'Requester::Organization Name' | uniq
```

It looks like that didn't remove duplicates. Let's learn more about `uniq`:

```
man uniq
```

In the description of the command, we see this text:

> Repeated lines in the input will not be detected if they are not adjacent, so it may be necessary to sort the files first.

It seems like `csvsort` could help us with this. Let's try to just see what happens when we *pipe* the output of `csvgrep` and `csvcut` to `csvsort` naively:

```
csvgrep -c 'Requester::Organization Name' -m 'Law' data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv | csvcut -c 'Requester::Organization Name' | csvsort
```

That looks promising. Note that this works because we only have one column in the output of `csvcut`. If we had more than one columns, we'd have to specify which one we wanted to use to sort using `-c`.

Now let's *pipe* the output of everything to uniq:

```
csvgrep -c 'Requester::Organization Name' -m 'Law' data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv | csvcut -c 'Requester::Organization Name' | csvsort | uniq
```

Finally, let's use `wc` to count lines. Remember, the output will include the header, so we need to subtract that from the count:

```
csvgrep -c 'Requester::Organization Name' -m 'Law' data/ice-foia-logs/2024-10_FOIA_Log.csv | csvcut -c 'Requester::Organization Name' | csvsort | uniq | wc -l
```
