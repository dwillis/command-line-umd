2024-ICFO-50246,2024-08-06,Poorva Aparaj,,"Questions regarding day trading by individuals on F1 OPT visa. 1) Is day trading or short-term trading legal/allowed ? Do the rules allow for an individual to perform day trading as a hobby, provided that they hold a full time job related to their degree/field of study. 2) If frequent trades aren't allowed, what is? Mixed /varying advice online. Some say nothing is allowed, some say 3 trades a week are fine as long as you don't become a Pattern Day Trader. 3) Does volume, time, monetary investment make a difference? How much is too much? Do returns need to be lower than monthly income from the full-time job? 4) Citizens from other countries can day-trade in US markets through international broker firms. Would it be legal if I have an international broker account as an Non-resident Indian, and then traded in the US markets? Or does my visa status disbar me from any short-term trading activities? 5) If day trading is not allowed or limited for people on F1 OPT visa, is there any other legal way to perform short-term trades as being a US resident without violating any laws? People outside US can invest in US markets, so can US citizens but are there any laws for people who are alien residents? The question is specifically for short-term trading (buying and selling within a single day)- not about F&O, short selling etc. 6) Please provide a link or document which has comprehensive laws and regulations related to stock market trading for workers on F1 OPT visa."
