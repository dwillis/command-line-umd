A residence north of town on 6 Mile road was raided by the Michigan State Police. This residence has many out buildings and is completely surrounded by large metal fencing & large gates. It is very much abnormal for the area and is quite concerning. There has been a lot of rumors circulating that it was used for very horrific things and the community here is extremely worried for the safety of our children and families. We have the right to know information about what is happening here around us to better protect ourselves, our families, and our community as a whole."

The operation targeted traffickers involved in the sex trafficking of minors in an area of Houston known as “the Bissonnet Track.” An ICE press release from September 8, 2023, indicated that “ten human traffickers were arrested during the operation, including four documented gang members and six gang associates. All 10 individuals were arrested pursuant to federal arrest warrants and are charged with various crimes such as sex trafficking of minors, sex trafficking of minors by force and conspiracy to sex traffic minors.” I am seeking copies of these federal arrest warrants and any other information providing the names of those arrested, the crimes they were suspected of committing, and any charges that wound up being filed as a result of these arrests."
